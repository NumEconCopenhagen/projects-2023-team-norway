# Inaugural project
In this project we solve a household model, for both discrete and continous choiches, where the agents maximize their utility. They can spend their time working in the market or at home. We also see how these decisions change for different levels of female wages while keeping male wages constant. Then we change alpha and sigma in order to minimize the measurement error between our regression estimate and the empirical work of Siminski and Yetsenga (2022). Lastly, we make an extension where we again fix alpha to 0,5 and make the female experience more disutility from work as women are more likely to experience harassment in the workplace and/or when comunting to the workplace. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
