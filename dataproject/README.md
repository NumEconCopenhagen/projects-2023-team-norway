# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **US Presidential Elections**, and in this project we import data from the US Census Bureau using API codes in order to retrieve data about the US population. We merge this dataset with a dataset on the presidential elections from MIT Election Data. We do a Fixed Effect Estimation where we want to see how a one percent increase in a demographic, race, affects the elections results. However, we have not suceeded in visualizing this just yet. Therefore, we visualize the election results for the elections 2008-2020 in different ways in order to show how different visualizations can show different aspects of the election. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. 1976-2020-president.csv (*https://electionlab.mit.edu/data#data*) 
2. API codes from the American Community Survey (*https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/variables.html*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
