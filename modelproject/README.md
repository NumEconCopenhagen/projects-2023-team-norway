# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **CGE MODEL** and it solves a simple computable equilibrium model for a closed economy. We also simulate X shocks. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
